          Church, in Christian doctrine, the Christian religious community as a whole, or a body or organization of
          Christian believers.

          The Greek word ekklēsia, which came to mean church, was originally applied in the Classical period to an
          official assembly of citizens. In the Septuagint (Greek) translation of the Old Testament (3rd–2nd century
          BCE), the term ekklēsia is used for the general assembly of the Jewish people, especially when gathered for a
          religious purpose such as hearing the Law (e.g., Deuteronomy 9:10, 18:16). In the New Testament it is used of
          the entire body of believing Christians throughout the world (e.g., Matthew 16:18), of the believers in a
          particular area (e.g., Acts 5:11), and also of the congregation meeting in a particular house—the
          “house-church” (e.g., Romans 16:5).

          After the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, his followers went forth according to his mandate to
          preach the Gospel and developed facilities for those who were converted. Rebuffed by the Jewish authorities,
          the Christians established their own communities, modeled on the Jewish synagogue. Gradually, the church
          worked out a governmental system based on the office of the bishop (episcopacy).

          A library is a collection of books, and possibly other materials and media, that is accessible for use by its
          members and members of allied institutions. Libraries provide physical (hard copies) or digital (soft copies)
          materials, and may be a physical location, a virtual space, or both. A library's collection normally includes
          printed materials which may be borrowed, and usually also includes a reference section of publications which
          may
          only be utilized inside the premises. Resources such as commercial releases of films, television programmes,
          other
          video recordings, radio, music and audio recordings may be available in many formats. These include DVDs,
          Blu-rays, CDs, cassettes, or other applicable formats such as microform. They may also provide access to
          information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

        <p>Debate is a process that involves formal discourse, discussion, and oral addresses on a particular topic or
          collection of topics, often with a moderator and an audience. In a debate, arguments are put forward for
          common
          opposing viewpoints. Debates have historically occurred in public meetings, academic institutions, debate
          halls,
          coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies.[1] Debates have also been conducted for educational
          and
          recreational purposes,[2] usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies.[3] These
          debates emphasized logical consistency, factual accuracy, and emotional appeal to an audience.[4][5] Modern
          forms of competitive debate also include rules for participants to discuss and decide upon the framework of
          the
          debates (how the debate will be judged).[5]


          A Debate among Scholars, Razmnama illustration
          Debating in various forms has a long history that can be traced back to the philosophical and political
          debates
          of Ancient Greece, such as Athenian Democracy or the Shastrartha in Ancient India. Modern forms of debating
          and
          the establishment of debating societies in the Western world occurred during the Age of Enlightenment in the
          18th century.[6]

          In Imperial China's Han Dynasty, debate amongst scholars was most famously portrayed in a series of debates
          known as the Discourses on Salt and Iron, held in 81 BCE. Named for its two most famous debates, by Emperor
          Zhao, these debates focused on the reformation of the economic policies implemented by Zhao's predecessor,
          Emperor Wu.[7]</p>
